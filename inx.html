  <h2>History</h2><hr>
  Between 1960 and 1973, Leitz (Leica)[1] patented an array of autofocus and corresponding sensor technologies. At photokina 1976, Leica had presented a camera based on their previous development, named Correfot, and in 1978 they displayed an SLR camera with fully operational autofocus.
  <br><br>
  The first mass-produced autofocus camera was the Konica C35 AF, a simple point and shoot model released in 1977. The Polaroid SX-70 Sonar OneStep was the first autofocus single-lens reflex camera, released in 1978.
  <br><br>
  The Pentax ME-F, which used focus sensors in the camera body coupled with a motorized lens, became the first autofocus 35 mm SLR in 1981.
  <br><br>
  In 1983 Nikon released the F3AF, their first autofocus camera, which was based on a similar concept to the ME-F.
  <br><br>
  The Minolta 7000, released in 1985, was the first SLR with an integrated autofocus system, meaning both the AF sensors and the drive motor were housed in the camera body, as well as an integrated film advance winder â€” which was to become the standard configuration for SLR cameras from this manufacturer, and also Nikon abandoned their F3AF system and integrated the autofocus-motor and sensors in the body.
  <br><br>
  Canon decided to discontinue their FD mount and switched to the completely electronic EF mount with motorised lenses in 1987.
  <br><br>
  Pentax was the first to introduce focusing distance measurement for SLR cameras with the FA and FA* series lenses from 1991. Their first KAF-mount Pentax lenses with AF had been introduced in 1989.[2]
  <br><br>
  In 1992, Nikon changed back to lens integrated motors with their AF-I and AF-S range of lenses; today their entry-level DSLRs do not have a focus motor in the body due to the availability of motors in all new developed AF-Lenses.
